Thought Haven AspNetCore
===

Wrappers and helpers built on top of Microsoft's wonderful AspNetCore and MVC libraries. Get started faster and easier while following enforced best practices.

SSL by default, antiforgery protection always on, strongly typed app page url builder, helpers for quicker startup code, and other best practices (such as static file caching out of the box). AspNetCore and MVC are already blissful, but these libraries empower you to do even more.
